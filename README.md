!Smart Mirror: The open source modular smart mirror platform.

**Smart Mirror** is a device that can display the userâ€™s image and provide customizable information on the display. Our lifestyle has evolved in such a way that optimizing time is the most important thing. **Smart Mirror** allows you to convert your hallway or bathroom mirror into your personal assistant. Our work is based on the idea that we all look at the mirror when we go out, so why wouldn't the mirror become smart.

**Smart Mirror** focuses on a modular plugin system and uses Electron as an application wrapper. So no more web server or browser installs necessary!

## Characteristics of Smart Mirror
The **Smart Mirror** will consist of an electronic display along with a one-way mirror for the informational display. Some characteristics of Smart Mirror are:
